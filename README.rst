Cyra
####

Cyra is a simple config framework for Python.

Cyra's ConfigBuilder makes it easy to specify your configuration.
The config can be read from and written to a toml file.

If the config file does not exist, Cyra will generate a new one populated with initial
values and annotated with helpful comments.
