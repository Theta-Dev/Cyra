Cyra
####

Cyra is a simple config framework for Python.

Cyra's ConfigBuilder makes it easy to specify your configuration.
The config can be read from and written to different formats (toml, yaml, json).

If the config file does not exist, Cyra will generate a new one populated with initial
values and annotated with helpful comments.
