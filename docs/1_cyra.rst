Just add your configuration class to your project's documentation
and Cyradoc does the rest.

.. code:: rst

  .. cyradoc:: sample_cfg.Config

You can use the ``builder.docstring('''My docstring''')`` method
to split your configuration into multiple sections with added
documentation.

------

.. cyradoc:: sample_cfg.Config
